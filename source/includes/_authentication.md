> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  -H 'Api-Key: meowmeowmeow'
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Firstcar uses API keys to allow access to the API.

Firstcar expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Api-Key: meowmeowmeow`

You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.
